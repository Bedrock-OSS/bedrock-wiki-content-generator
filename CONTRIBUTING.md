Welcome! Thank you for considering contributing to this project.
Not to turn this project back into harvester (awful code and the way it is done), we ask you to follow some rules when contributing:

- Explanation
When adding a new function, comment it via docstring. Also don't forget to add information to content_list.txt file.
- Follow the style
Try not to break the general style of code, because if the code is similar everywhere, it is easy to understand it.
- Function details
Don't use extra files when writing functions, such as files with data to use it later. (Maybe a .tmp folder in the future for it, but still, try not to use it.)
If one method is used a lot, consider writing a function in wiki_tools for it. After you did that, update content generation code.
- Packs
Don't forget to use .gitignore for unzipped packs and keep custom content only in .zip.
